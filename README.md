# Earth & Moon Gravity Simulation

This project was created to experiment with gravity in outer space. First, I played around with simulating gravity by disabiling the "Use Gravity" Unity preset and applying my own gravity calculations based on Newtown's Laws of Physics. I was inspired by this video demonstrating how to [Simulate Gravity in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ouu3D_VHx9o). From there, I worked independently to simulate the moon orbiting the earth (inspired by a CS1 lab, which was used as reference)!

For more detailed documentation on our file structure and specific functions in the code, feel free to check the project files themselves.

#### Pre-requisites
1. Unity Hub: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download
2. Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download (optional, but good platform for writing scripts)

#### Development Setup Instructions
1. Fork/Clone the project.
2. Open the project with `Unity Hub` and make sure to use the correct Unity version (2020.3.18f1).

#### Building and Running
1. You can run it directly from Unity -- otherwise, you can build an executable and run it from there.
